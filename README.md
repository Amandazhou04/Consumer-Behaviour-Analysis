#### Project Overview  

As a data analyst supporing the sales & marketing department of a fashion retail company, the task here is to conduct an analysis on the recent customer purchase data to draw meaningful insights on the customer demographics, sales information and purchase behaviour. These insights should be useful to the team to better understand the customers' purchase behaviour and preferences. This will in turn equip the team with sufficient insights to formulate effective promotion strategies and targeted marketing promotion tactics.  

This project is done on Power BI and the dataset is taken from Kaggle. [Link to dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zeesolver/consumer-behavior-and-shopping-habits-dataset/data)
